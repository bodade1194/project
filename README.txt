                I have done this project using data structure and file handling in c language. Library.h file contains all the required header files and function declarations used in code. main.c contains calling those declared functions and using that result to manage a library. datastructure.jpg contains diagram of the datastructure used in the code.
                I tried using gtk to create better GUI, but i could not manage to do so. However, I wish to do better GUi and I am working on it. Here in this code I used user input method as input to the code.
